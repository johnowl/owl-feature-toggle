# Feature Toggle Engine

This is a complete feature toggle solution, it is divided in some components:

* owl-rules: it`s our rule engine, it has its own language to write the rules.
* owl-toggle-server: it`s the main piece of this project, it`s here that we plug all the pieces together.
* owl-toggle-client: it`s a client to plug in your projects and use the feature toggles.
* owl-toggle-sample-app: it`s a sample application to see the feature toggle in action.
